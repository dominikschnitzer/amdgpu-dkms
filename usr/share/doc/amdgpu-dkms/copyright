This is a modified subset of the Linux kernel sources.
Linux was written by Linus Torvalds <Linus.Torvalds@cs.Helsinki.FI>
and others.

This package was put together by AMD, in part from sources retrieved from the
upstream linux git. All binaries are built at install time; this package
includes all sources, which are installed under '/usr/src/'.

All files located in /usr/src/*/firmware are subject to a firmware license,
which can be found in '/usr/share/doc/amdgpu-dkms-firmware/LICENSE'.
